# Astro-Pi-20-21-codes.
A few python codes used to study data from ISS Astro Pi.

Attached are three python codes used to plot data recieved from ISS in 2020/2021 ed Astro Pi MSL.

eposat_plotting_script.py uses matplotlib to plot data from data01.csv file (which must be in the same directory of eposat_plotting_script.py).

eposat_plotting_two_trajct.py uses matplotlib to draw two lat/long trajectories (from jesto_data01.csv file and from data01.csv file which must be both in the same directory of eposat_plotting_two_traject.py).
